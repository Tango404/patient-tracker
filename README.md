# Patient Tracker

This is a small patient and appointment tracker CLI program that I created using the fundementals of C programming language.

## Editing the program
<hr>
Feel free to make any changes to the program, if you wish to do so, all the header files, and C files have comments listed in them to explain what each file contains, and what the functions do in each file. If you have a change you wish to commit, just open a pull request!
